    <h1>Dolma</h1>
    <img src="../images/dolma.jpg" alt="picture of dolma">
    <h2>Dolma is a stuffed vegetable dish that has so many variations across the Middle East, Turkey, the Balkans, and Central Asia.</h2>
    <p>Iraqi dolma is famous throughout the middle east as one of the most delicious types of dolma you'll eat.
         Vegetables, stuffed with seasoned rice and vegetables and cooked in a tomato broth. </p>
    <p>There are so many versions of dolma just within Iraq (let alone outside of Iraq),
         and I love them all. But I'm going to share the one near and dear to my heart; my mom's dolma.</p>
    
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <h4>For the stuffing mixture:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg minced beef</li>
        <li>4 cups medium grain rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons salt</li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoons black peppper</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons tomato paste equivalent to 156 mL the small cans</li>
        <li>2 red or orange bell peppers</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the liquid</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups of water</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 spoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the eggplant: cut the eggplant into 2 pieces similar in size to the photos.
             Then using a sharp pairing knife (which is a knife with a short blade), place the eggplant on a cut
             ting board sideways with your hand on top.
              Using your dominant hand, start coring around the inside of the eggplant, going around and around and
               slowly inserting the knife in deeper as you go around.
               Do this until you reach the other side or until you can use your fingers to scoop out the flesh. If 
               you don't get it all out, 
               keep using your knife to cut away the flesh. You can also insert your knife from the other side to
                help loosen the flesh further.
                Refer to recipe video for detailed method.</li>
        <li>For the zucchini: start by scraping away the skin using a sharp knife, then trim the ends. 
            Cut the zucchini into 3 pieces then core using the same method as the eggplant</li>
        <li>For the pepper: carefully cut around the stem and remove it, then using your fingers, 
            remove the inner seeds and any white parts. 
            You can use a small knife to get in there and loosen them</li>
        <li>
            For the onion: first peel the onion, then dig around the end where the root was and carve it out
             slightly (this helps separate the layers). Make a long cut lengthwise all the way to the centre - 
             do not cut past the centre. T
             hen microwave the onions for 1 minute to soften the layers slightly (you can also boil for a minute). 
            Wait for it to cool, then use your fingers to carefully dislodge the layers and pop them out
        </li>
        <li>
            For the swiss chard: before stuffing, wash the leaves well and then submerge in a bowl of boiling water 
            for 3 seconds. Remove them a
            nd place them on a tray. This helps wilt the leaves and makes
             them more pliable for stuffing. Then, cut the thick stems off the leaves, and cut the leaf into 2 or 3 pieces,
              depending on the size.
        </li>
        <li>For the grape leaves: grape leaves come in jars submerged in water (I don't recommend using the frozen ones). 
            Generally the leaves are salted, so befor
            e using them, soak them in water for at least an hour to
             get rid of excess salt, then wash them a few times and drain. You can squeeze them carefully to get rid of excess water. </li>
    </ol>
