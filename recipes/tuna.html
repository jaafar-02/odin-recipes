    <p>Tuna Mornay is how you elevate canned tuna above a glum pantry staple or worse still, 
        a desperate meal eaten straight from the can! It's a tuna casserole pasta bake with a creamy sauce
        , sweet pops of corn and crunchy topping, baked until golden and bubbly.
        Simple to make, economical and oh-so-delish!</p>
